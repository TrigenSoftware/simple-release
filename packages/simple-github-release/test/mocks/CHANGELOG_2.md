- "Why keep a changelog?" section.

### Changed
- Start using "changelog" over "change log" since it's the common usage.
- Start versioning based on the current English version at 0.3.0 to help
translation authors keep things up-to-date.

- Section about "changelog" vs "CHANGELOG".

## [0.3.0] - 2015-12-03
### Added
- RU translation from [@aishek](https://github.com/aishek).

## [0.2.0] - 2015-10-06
### Changed
- Remove exclusionary mentions of "open source" since this project can
benefit both "open" and "closed" source projects equally.
